### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Jayanth
#### Just a normal CFD guy ;)
### Fan of Prof Thurey's research work , was happiest when man who won oscar for simulation replied!(Read as humble , provides FREE Book)

### Never fear rejection
1. Twice rejected by IIT Madras for PhD , Tried third time
2. Once rejected by IIT Bombay for PhD , Trying second time
3. Asked to get out , Lied , misguided was denied computing facility for novel work at IIT Dharwad.
4. After which got rejected by my own alma matter which is in my hometown for PhD when there were just 3 people for interview :D , Inspite of requesting Director for help saying can't live good life in Dharwad with toxic environment from earlier guide. The message is clear , DO NOT CARE

### "I am thankful to all those who said NO to me. It is because of them I  started doing by myself"
