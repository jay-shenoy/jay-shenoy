I'm Jayanth , expertise in LBM. Plan is to apply it everywhere as small tribute to Ludwig Boltzmann.

Skills: CFD , Heat transfer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CFD , ML in fluid dynamics & HT 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Other particle based methods like SPH 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on CFD , ML in fluid dynamics & HT 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for doing PhD in SPH/Vortex particle method or Experimental methods combined with NN/inverse problems
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about LBM
