### Hi there 👋, Jayanth
#### Just a normal CFD guy ;)
### Fan of Prof Thurey's research work , was happiest when man who won oscar for simulation replied!(Read as humble , provides FREE Book)
### Will try for post doc & meet him

### Made wrong decision to not have studied just like him in FAU Erlangen where I had admit
 

### "I am thankful to all those who said NO to me. It is because of them I  started doing by myself"
