### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Jayanth
#### Just a normal CFD guy ;)
### Fan of Prof Thurey's research work , was happiest when man who won oscar for simulation replied!(Read as humble , provides FREE Book)
### Twice rejected by IIT Madras for PhD , Tried third time
### Once rejected by IIT Bombay for PhD , Trying second time
### Once rejected by my own alma matter for PhD

### "I am thankful to all those who said NO to me. It is because of them I did it myself"

I'm Jayanth , expertise in LBM. 


Plan is to apply it everywhere as small tribute to Ludwig Boltzmann.

Skills: CFD , Heat transfer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CFD , ML in fluid dynamics & HT 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Other particle based methods like SPH 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on CFD , ML in fluid dynamics & HT 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for doing PhD in SPH/Vortex particle method/Traditional CFD or Experimental methods combined with NN/inverse problems
