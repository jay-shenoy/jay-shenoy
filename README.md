### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Jayanth here
### Currently doctoral researcher in climate science @IIT Bombay
### Fan of Prof Thurey's research work , was happiest when man who won oscar for simulation replied!(Read as humble , provides FREE Neural network book which is hands on)
### Will try for post doc & meet him , use simulation in hollywood movies like him :D
### Made wrong decision to not have studied just like him in FAU Erlangen where I had admit
 

### "I am thankful to all those who said NO to me. It is because of them I  started doing by myself"
