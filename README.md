### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Jayanth
#### Just a normal CFD guy ;)
### Fan of Prof Thurey's research work , was happiest when man who won oscar for simulation replied!(Read as humble)
### There lot of Prof whom I admire & look upto , be it Prof C Balaji(For all fantastic lectures , selfless in sharing knowledge with no iota of jealousy which is huge in our country so far expereinced by me , from deliberate don't know to denial of computing facility for novel work) , Prof Prabhu (who has created PySPH , Mayavi)

I'm Jayanth , expertise in LBM. Plan is to apply it everywhere as small tribute to Ludwig Boltzmann.

Skills: CFD , Heat transfer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CFD , ML in fluid dynamics & HT 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Other particle based methods like SPH 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on CFD , ML in fluid dynamics & HT 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for doing PhD in SPH/Vortex particle method/Traditional CFD or Experimental methods combined with NN/inverse problems
